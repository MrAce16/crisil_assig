1. New Routes:
Summary Route for Agencies:
Proposed Endpoint: /api/v2/agency/<TOPTIER_AGENCY_CODE>/summary/
Description: Combine budgetary resources, new awards count, and program activities into a single response. This reduces the number of API calls needed for holistic analysis.
State Data by Fiscal Year:
Proposed Endpoint: /api/v2/recipient/state/<FISCAL_YEAR>/
Description: Include grants, loans, and population data in one endpoint for a specific fiscal year, simplifying state-level queries.
2. Renaming Input Parameters:
Rename fiscal_year to year for consistency with common naming conventions.
Rename toptier_agency_code to agency_code for brevity.
3. Output Data Format Adjustments:
Include total fields (e.g., total_population, total_awards) at the root level of responses to provide aggregate summaries.
Standardize monetary fields (e.g., total_obligations, grant_total) to include both integer values and formatted strings ($1,000,000).
4. Documentation Enhancements:
Provide comprehensive examples for each endpoint, including both input and output JSON.
Clearly define all possible values for parameters like award_type_codes.
Include common use cases and sample queries for developers.
